    <p>This site lets users create settings which every website can see.</p>

    <p>Since manual approval from the user is required for each
    setting, the privacy risk seems small.  But users need to be
    careful not to create any settings which would cause them to be
    tracked in a way they don't want, of course.</p>

    <p>Everything is done client-side in JavaScript.  Data never goes
    to our server; it lives in the brower's localStorage.  One might
    call this "cross-origin cookies".  To balance the privacy threat
    that suggests, we always prompt the user before saving
    anything.</p>
    
    <h2>Managing Settings</h2>
    
    <p>Web Apps propose settings by sending the user (maybe in an iframe) to <tt>http://globalsettings.org/add#<i>key</i>=<i>value</i></tt>.  Then the user can save them or not, as they like.</p>

    <p>Try it with: <a href="http://globalsettings.org/add#likes-infinite-scroll=true">http://globalsettings.org/add#likes-infinite-scroll=true</a> or <a href="http://globalsettings.org/add#adult-content=never">http://globalsettings.org/add#adult-content=never</a></p>

    <h2>Reading Settings</h2>
    
    <p>Web Apps read the settings by opening http://globalsettings.org/min in an iframe.  As soon as the iframe loads, they should get a 'message' event containing all the global settings.</p>

    <p>For example, one might include this, somewhere in the body of the page:</p>

    <pre>&lt;iframe src="http://globalsettings.org/min" style="display: none">&lt;/iframe></pre>

    <p>And include this in the JavaScript:</p>
    <pre>
 window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    const origin = event.origin || event.originalEvent.origin
    if (origin !== "http://globalsettings.org") return;
    const settings = event.data
    if (settings.favoriteColorOrWhatever) ...
 }
    </pre>
